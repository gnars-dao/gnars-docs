This tutorial walks you through creating a Gnars content coin. A content coin ties your action-sports clip to a fungible token so fans can support your work. You’ll pair your clip with an existing token on Zora/Base (typically $GNARS) instead of deploying a new token.

## Before you start

- **Connected wallet:** Have a wallet (e.g., MetaMask) on the Base network with a little ETH for gas.
- **Existing creator token:** Gnars uses existing tokens on Zora/Base; the default is **$GNARS Creator Coin**, which provides liquidity and community support.
- **Media ready:** Prepare an image or video (MP4, WebM, MOV) up to 420 MB; consider a separate thumbnail for video.

## Steps

1. **Open the create-coin page**

   - Go to `gnars.com/create-coin` and connect your wallet. Ensure you’re on Base.

2. **Fill out coin details**

   - **Coin Name:** Up to ~50 characters.
   - **Symbol:** Short token symbol (stored uppercase, ~10 characters).
   - **Description (optional):** Brief pitch (up to ~500 characters).

3. **Choose a backing currency**

   - Select **$GNARS Creator Coin (default)** or another token you already have on Zora/Base.
   - Buying your coin first buys $GNARS, then your coin—adding liquidity and strengthening the GNARS economy.

4. **Upload media**

   - Supported images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG.
   - Supported videos: MP4 (recommended), WebM, MOV.
   - Optionally pick a custom thumbnail when uploading video.

5. **Review and create**
   - Summary shows: media upload to Zora IPFS, metadata validation, wallet confirmation, deployment on Base.
   - Click **Create Coin** and confirm in your wallet. After processing, the coin goes live on Gnars TV.

## Troubleshooting

- **Button disabled:** Fill required fields and ensure wallet is connected to Base.
- **Media upload issues:** Confirm file type/size; reload and retry if needed.
- **Gas fees:** If high, wait and try again later.

## Summary

Connect your wallet, complete coin details, pick a backing currency (usually $GNARS), upload media, and confirm. Using an existing token aligns your clip with the broader Gnars ecosystem and gives fans an easy way to support you.
