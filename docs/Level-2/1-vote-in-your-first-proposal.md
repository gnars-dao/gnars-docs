# Vote in Your First Proposal

Voting in Gnars DAO is a crucial way to participate and have a say in the community’s direction. Whether it’s for approving funding for a new skate event or deciding on a community initiative, each vote helps shape the future of the DAO.

### How Voting Works

Voting is an on-chain action, meaning it’s recorded directly on the blockchain and can be executed in several ways:

- **Directly on the Blockchain**: You can cast your vote by interacting with the smart contract itself using a wallet like MetaMask.
- **Using a Block Explorer**: For those who are comfortable navigating blockchain data, you can vote through platforms like Etherscan or its equivalent on the Base network.
- **Through a Gnar Frontend**: While these frontends are designed to make the voting process easier, it’s fair to say that they’re still a work in progress—so don’t expect the smoothest experience just yet.

### Voting Frontends for Gnars DAO

Here are some frontends that can help simplify (somewhat) the process of casting your vote:

1. **[Nouns.build](https://nouns.build/dao/base/0x880fb3cf5c6cc2d7dfc13a993e839a9411200c17/6332?tab=activity)**: A platform designed to support governance for Nouns-style DAOs, providing proposal details, voting options, and a clear transaction history.
2. **[Gnars.wtf](https://gnars.wtf)**: This frontend is tailored for Gnars holders, with a streamlined interface for viewing proposals and casting votes. Just be prepared for a bit of a learning curve!

3. **[Gnars.pro](https://gnars.pro)**: Another option for viewing and voting on proposals. This frontend also integrates with other community tools, offering a slightly different experience for navigating DAO governance.

### Things to Remember

- Make sure your wallet is connected to the **Base network** when interacting with these frontends.
- Each Gnar NFT represents **1 vote**, so the more Gnars you hold, the greater your influence.
- Your vote is **recorded on-chain**, meaning it can’t be altered once submitted.

While the process might take a bit of getting used to, being part of the decision-making is a big part of what makes decentralized governance powerful.
