# How to Propose a Nounstacle in Your City

## 0. Introduction

A Nounstacle is a durable sculpture designed to last, serving as a nounish gift to the city. These sculptures are meant to leave a legacy of infinite art, created for fun and proliferation, and can be used in multiple ways. They not only enhance the aesthetic appeal of the city but also provide a unique and interactive experience for the community.

## 1. Find a Place

Are you a local shredder in the chosen place? If so, you probably know how it works. Identify a public space that could benefit from a Nounstacle. Consider visibility, accessibility, and the potential for community engagement. Engage with local authorities or property owners for permissions and support.

### If you decide to create a custom design, make sure to review the existing guides before sketching a new idea. These guides contain valuable information about constructing gnarly obstacles that can help you in your project.

## 3. Community Engagement

Involve the community in the planning process. This could be through workshops, meetings, or online platforms. Gather feedback, ideas, and support. This not only enriches the project but also ensures it's welcomed and cherished by the community.


## 4. Propose to Gnars Dao

You can get funded by Gnars Dao for creating a Nounstacle through a Dao Proposal. Check out [this tutorial](https://nouns.build/guidelines) to learn more about creating proposals on Gnars. A well-crafted proposal is essential to get the necessary support and approval for your Nounstacle. 


1. **Draft Your Proposal**: Clearly outline your design, the location, and the benefits of the Nounstacle. Include sketches, dimensions, and any other relevant details. [HackMd](https://hackmd.io) is a good text collaborative text draft tool very used by the community.
2. **Submit for Review on Discord or WarpCast**: Once your proposal is ready, submit it for review. The community will evaluate its feasibility and impact.
3. **Submit the Proposal onChain:** You need a certain number of Gnars to create a proposal. If you don't have enough Gnars. Engage with the community and gather the required support. See More about [Submiting Good Proposals Here](https://nouns.build/guidelines)
4. **Get Approval**: If your proposal meets the criteria and gains enough support, it will be approved, and you can proceed with the installation.


## 6. Implementation

Once everything is in place, start the construction of the Nounstacle. Ensure safety standards are met and that the installation is durable. If you are placing it in a public place make sure its heavy enough so it does not get stolen

## 7. Maintenance and Legacy

Plan for the long-term maintenance of the Nounstacle to ensure it remains a safe and enjoyable space for everyone. Consider creating a small committee within the community to oversee this.

## 8. QR Codes/NFC Tags

One interesting aspect of a Nounstacle is generating curiosity and engagement. Including QR codes or NFC tags is a great way to achieve this. These tags can link to one of the Gnars websites or a custom page that explains Gnars in a way that suits the location. This adds an interactive element to the sculpture, making it not just a piece of art but also a point of information and interest.

By following these steps, you can successfully propose and install a Nounstacle in your city, creating a lasting impact and a new space for community interaction and enjoyment.
