## What is Gnars DAO? ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® \m/

Gnars DAO is a permissionless, open-source community and action sports accelerator, created to support athletes, creators, and enthusiasts in growing the world of extreme sports. As a subDAO of Nouns DAO, Gnars‚Äô image and impact grow alongside its builders, with every project and initiative strengthening both the brand and the community. Gnars brings shredders ‚Äúonchain,‚Äù helping them gain visibility and get rewarded for their creativity and influence. It‚Äôs a collaborative space where anyone can directly shape the culture through shared decision-making and decentralized creation.

### How it Works

Gnars operates as a global collective of athletes and supporters, using a decentralized governance system to decide how to best support its members and fund initiatives. By participating, you‚Äôre not just a member‚Äîyou‚Äôre part of a community driving the future of action sports and the creator economy.

In practical terms, Gnars makes use of cutting-edge technology to bring creators and athletes onchain in a way that was previously unimaginable. Just like getting online in the 90s changed the game, getting onchain today is revolutionizing how athletes and creators connect with their audiences. Rooted in a strong D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself) culture, Gnars empowers individuals to take initiative, create their own opportunities, and directly shape the community‚Äôs future ‚Äî building a sustainable path forward for everyone involved. Through ongoing auctions, community members fund a shared treasury, and all spending decisions are made collectively.

### A Community-Driven Brand

The goal of Gnars is to grow a community-owned brand that is built by its members, for its members. Our projects range from public goods like skatepark refurbishments to creative endeavors like film projects and community-led events. We focus on initiatives that build up the extreme sports community and support creators on their journey, no matter where they‚Äôre starting from.

### Why Join?

Gnars isn‚Äôt just about funding‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating opportunities. It‚Äôs a permissionless space where anyone can propose and support ideas that push the boundaries of creativity and sport. From seasoned skaters to newcomers, everyone has a voice in how the community evolves. With no gatekeepers, everyone has the chance to contribute. Action Sports Onchain Culture.

### Getting Started

After your gnarly first paddles with the community, dive in and get involved. We hang out on Discord and share updates across, Farcaster, X, Zora, and Instagram. From there, you can participate in various activities and stay informed about all the latest developments and news within the Gnars and Nouns ecosystem.

If you‚Äôre interested in having a voice in how we manage the treasury, you can use your earnings to bid in our community NFT auctions and actively take part in the decision-making process, Gnarly Pod's. 

### Shred for Bread 

The whole point is to have fun and make an impact‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre uploading Action Sports videos, supporting local projects, or getting involved in new initiatives. We‚Äôre here to bring a million shredders onchain, so they can experience firsthand that there‚Äôs more to being a creator than chasing likes. Extremely Nounish.
