Gnar TV is the always-on feed for Gnars clips and drops, where creators share skate, surf, and action-sports moments that can be collected as “content coins.” It’s the easiest way to watch the latest sessions, back projects you like, and earn alongside the community.

## What are content coins?

- Each clip on Gnar TV mints a content coin that can be collected by viewers.
- Collecting supports the creator and the Gnars ecosystem; some drops include rewards or allow-list perks for future mints.
- Coins are onchain collectibles, so you can hold, gift, or trade them later.

## How buying works

1. **Open a clip** and connect your wallet.
2. **Choose quantity** of the content coin you want to collect.
3. **Confirm the transaction** to mint and receive the coin.

### Batch buying

If you want multiple coins in one go, use the batch option when available:

1. Select “Batch buy.”
2. Enter the number of coins you want (or pick a preset tier).
3. Confirm once to mint them all in a single transaction.

## Reviewing

1. Connect your wallet (Base chain supported) and ensure you have ETH for gas.
2. Browse the feed, open a clip, and collect its content coin.
3. Share your favorite drops—more eyes can mean more rewards for creators and collectors.

## Tips

- Watch for limited editions or time-limited drops; quantities may be capped.
- Check creator notes for utility, allow-lists, or future benefits tied to the coin.
- If a transaction fails, verify network fees and retry with a slightly higher gas setting.
