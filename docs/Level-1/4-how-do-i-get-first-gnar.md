# How to Get Your First Gnar

There are a few ways to get your hands on a Gnar NFT, whether it’s through bidding at the auction, purchasing from a marketplace, or requesting one through a proposal. Here’s how you can do it:

## 1. **Participate in the Auction**

The primary way to acquire a Gnar NFT is by participating in the **Gnars NFT auction** held at [**gnars.com**](https://gnars.com).

- The auction runs continuously
- To bid, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet (use MetaMask or any WalletConnect-compatible wallet).
- **Note**: The auction now operates on the **Base network**, so ensure that your wallet is configured to interact with Base and not Ethereum.
- Connect your wallet, place your bid, and monitor the auction until it closes.
- If you win, the Gnar will be automatically transferred to your wallet.

## 2. **Buy on Secondary Marketplaces**

If you prefer to buy directly or want to browse different options, you can check out the secondary marketplace on **OpenSea**:

- **[OpenSea on Base](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0x880fb3cf5c6cc2d7dfc13a993e839a9411200c17)**: Make sure to select the correct network (Base) when browsing and purchasing, as Gnars NFTs have migrated from Ethereum to Base.

By purchasing through OpenSea, you can choose specific Gnars or filter by traits to find one that matches your style.

## 3. **Peer-to-Peer Trades**

If you know someone in the community or want to negotiate directly, peer-to-peer (P2P) trades can be an option. Use third-party services like **NFT Trader** to handle the exchange safely. Always double-check the smart contract address and network (Base) before finalizing any trade.

## 4. **Make a Gnars Onboarding Proposal (For Shredders)**

If you’re a skater or contributor looking to join the community, you can submit an onboarding proposal to get a Gnar for free.

1. Check out the [**onboarding guide**](https://gnars.center/docs/Level-3/how-to-request-gnars) at Gnars Center.
2. Create a proposal that outlines your contributions to skateboarding or the community.
3. The DAO will vote on your proposal, and if accepted, you’ll receive a Gnar NFT as a way to join.

This option is recommended for those who actively contribute to the skateboarding scene and want to be recognized by the community.

## Choosing the Right Option

- **Auction**: For active participation and real-time bidding.
- **OpenSea on Base**: If you want to choose a specific Gnar or buy directly.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Direct negotiation.
- **Onboarding Proposal**: For skaters and contributors seeking to join through recognition rather than purchase.

Pick the one that fits your situation best, and remember to use the **Base network** when exploring your options.
